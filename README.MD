# Building Sockets - A 0 A.D. Gameplay Mod

## Goal

The aim of the mod is to give the users the possibility to build buildings on top of each other or on specific spots. This can be useful for mines, to boost specific gathering, to allow construction things such as bridges (That would only work by garisonning and setting the rally point on the other side of the bridge)
